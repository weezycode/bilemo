Bilemo
</h1>

## *BileMo is a company offering a whole selection of high-end cell phones*.

*I am in charge of the development of the mobile showcase of the company BileMo. BileMo's business model is not to sell its products directly on the site, but to provide all platforms that wish to access the catalog via an API (Application Programming Interface). It is therefore a sale exclusively in B2B (business to business).*

*A certain amount of information has been identified. It must be possible to:*

* *consult the list of BileMo products*
* *consult the details of a BileMo product*
* *consult the list of registered users linked to a client on the website*
* *consult the details of a registered user linked to a client* 
* *add a new user linked to a customer*
* *delete a user added by a customer*

* *Only referenced clients can access the APIs. API clients must be authenticated via JWT*
